Unicode timetables

- Basic template made using Mark Lodato's avaScript Unicode box drawing demo:  https://github.com/MarkLodato/
- This was then copied and tweaked in Sublime-Text3 to construct tables of different spacing

TIPS:
- When editing timetables in sublime text, turn off word wrap and make use of multiple selections
(Alt + Shift + Up/Down on Linux). 
- To fill in the timetable, use overtype instead of insert mode (INS).
- Ctrl + Left/Right will jump to the next slot of the timetable.
- Save your timetable to a file and use 'cat my_timetable' (or 'more my_timetable') to print the contents of my_timetable to the console. Consider defining a 'timetable' alias in bash with this command.
- cat may be used to display multiple timetables at once.
- Obviously, your terminal emulator must support unicode.
